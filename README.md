## Getting Started

Open the terminal in the project folder and run the development server to see the project:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

On mobile devices, there is an animation that is supposed to work with the accelerometer, but most devices block data from HTTP sites (such as this one). You can still observe it using the browser's console.
