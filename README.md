## Getting Started

Open the terminal in the project folder and run the development server to see the project:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

On mobile devices, there is an animation supposed to work with the accelerometer device, but most of the devices blocks data from HTTP sites (like this). You can still observe it with the browser's console.
